## [jaday.io](https://jaday.io)

I use [cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) as my static site generator. The backbone CSS is based on [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), and the rest of it is homegrown or borrowed from other websites.

The `_dev` folder contains tools or asset generators that I have written to generate content for the site.

The actual site is hosted on the [`master`](https://github.com/z2oh/z2oh.github.io/tree/master) branch. When the [`dev`](https://github.com/z2oh/z2oh.github.io/) branch gets updated, [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) builds my site with cobalt and deploys it to the `master` branch.
