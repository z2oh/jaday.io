            <h1>Solutions to the USC Spring 2018 Code-a-Thon</h1>
            <p>It isn't necessary to have read <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">CLRS</a> cover-to-cover to be able
                to compete in Code-a-Thons, although owning a copy certainly helps. Many of this year's problems were
                conceived while flipping through these pages, thinking up back stories for questions whose solutions
                were in pseudocode in front of me. I wrote one fewer question than I had intended to this semester,
                although only two out of the 71 participants in the upper division were able to complete the problem
                set, so it would seem the overall competition difficulty was ideal. With one finisher clocking in at
                just under nine hours (wow!) and the other at just over 23 hours (although analysis of submission times
                indicates a much deserved sleeping break), the competition provided a difficult challenge that was not
                insurmountable for our quick witted competitors. I am extremely satisfied with the performance of this
                semester's participants, and I thank the USC ACM chapter for their efforts in organizing the event, and
                to the <a href="http://sc.edu">University of South Carolina</a> and <a
                    href="http://krum.io">Krumware</a> for their support.</p>
            <p>Before we go over the solutions, I will outline the format of the competition. Participants had 24 hours
                to solve a series of programming challenges. Code-a-Thons are distinctly different from Hack-a-Thons,
                and are much more akin to programming math competitions. There are several high-profile contests of this
                nature, including <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/">Google Code Jam</a> and <a
                    href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM's ICPC</a>. The USC Code-a-Thon is split up into 4 divisons,
                which roughly correspond to 1st semester CS students, 2nd semester CS students, 3rd semester CS
                students, and 4th (and up) semester CS students. "And up" in the highest division refers to
                upperclassmen, as well as graduate students. As it would make little sense to expect a first semester
                freshman to be able to complete the same difficulty challenges as a graduate student, we further divide
                the divisions into an upper and lower division. Lower division problems often deal with elementary data
                structures (stacks for example) or with basic algorithms (like binary search). Upper divison problems
                deal with advanced topics in computer science, including algorithmic design, combinatorics, graph
                theory, and more. The difficulty gap between these two divisions is quite large. We use <a
                    href="https://hackerrank.com">Hackerrank</a> to host our competitions, and you can see the problems
                in their original format by following the links below. If you are interested in these types of problems,
                I encourage you to visit the problems and attempt them yourself, or to at least ponder their solutions
                before looking at the ones provided below. Hackerrank allows you to submit code in a variety of
                languages, and will automatically test your program on a variety of test cases provided by the problem
                author.</p>

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>I will refrain from going over the solutions to the lower division problems, as most of them have fairly
                straightforward solutions. If there is interest, I may add these solutions at a later date. In the mean
                time, here are the solutions to the upper division problem set. These are organized in the order in
                which the problems appeared to contestents, and are approximately in increasing order of difficulty.</p>
            <h4>Problem 1: Leonhard's Libations</h4>
            <p>Every semester we try to include a trick question where the problem appears to be a programming problem,
                but the programming solution is incredibly difficult or time-consuming. The best example of one such
                trick problem required nothing more than knowledge of the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">four color theorem</a> and 7 characters of
                Python 2: <code>print 4</code>.</p>
            <p>This problem is not quite as elegant as that one, but it got the job done.</p>
            <p>Several of the mathematically inclined participants immediately recognized the formula in the problem
                description:</p>
            <p>$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{1}{i!}$$</p>
            <p>which converges to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)">$e$</a> when $n =
                \infty$.</p>
            <p>The question asks the programmer to output the value of this formula for various values of $n$ (with $1
                \leq n \leq 2^{2^{2^{2^{2} } } }$), <strong>rounded to six decimal places</strong>. The upper bound for
                $n$ is a 19729 digit decimal number, which gives a hint that performing any real computation with $n$ is
                infeasible. Let's look at a table of corresponding values of $n$ and $f(n)$ (which is $n$ applied to the
                formula above):</p>

            <p>Aha! a pattern emerges. As $n$ tends to infinity, $f(n)$ converges to $e$, and with $n &gt; 8$, our
                approximation of $e$ does not get any better when we limit it to only six decimal places. Since we have
                only nine possible cases, we can provide a solution to this problem without using any sort math at
                runtime. In Python 3, this solution might look like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">line = input()

n = -1

            <p>There were several (subtle) hints to the solution in the problem text. The problem name, "Leonhard's
                Libations", is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>,
                the mathematician for which $e$ is named. Additionally, the sentence, "On any given day, Leonhard knows
                his limits," (and the many other references to limits) was to indicate that perhaps the limit of the
                proposed formula should be considered. We had 33 students solve this successfully. Even more recognized
                that the formula converged to $e$, but they couldn't quite figure out how to express this in code.</p>
            <h4>Problem 2: Pineapple Pack</h4>
            <p>This problem was the only problem of the hard problem set that I did not write. For an entirely unrelated
                reason, this was also the problem with which we had the most trouble. I tend to use Python for
                Code-a-Thons for its concise syntax, expressiveness, and arbitrary precision arithmetic. Not having to
                worry about integer overflow (or the verbosity of <a
                    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html"><code>BigInteger</code></a>)
                is a huge boon. I haven't used Python for many floating point programs, since the Code-a-Thon problems I
                author tend to avoid floating point altogether; using string comparison to check solutions falls short
                for floating point output when you allow participants to submit code in a <a
                    href="http://0.30000000000000004.com/">variety of programming languages</a>.</p>
            <p>My naïveté and crunch-time-coding led me to assume that Python would provide arbitrary precision
                arithmetic for <em>non</em>-integral calculations out of the box. It does not (one must use the <a
                    href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/decimal.html"><code>decimal</code></a> module). More
                specifically, I assumed that <code>x // y</code> was equivalent to <code>int(x / y)</code> (in Python,
                <code>//</code> is the integer divison operator. This operator has equivalent functionality to most
                other language's divison operators; thanks <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/">PEP
                    238</a>). Try executing the following line in a Python REPL:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">int(9007199254740993 / 1) == 9007199254740993 // 1
</code></pre>
            <p>You will be met with the output <code>False</code>. The number in that example is actually the smallest
                positive integer $x$ where the above statement is <code>False</code>. This is because <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">double precision
                    floating point</a> specifies 53 bits of significand precision. Since $9007199254740993 = 2^{53}+1$,
                it is not guaranteed to be able to be accurately represented as a floating point number (although
                $2^{53}+2$ works fine, see the Wikipedia page linked above for the reason why).</p>
            <p>Here you came for a solution to a Code-a-Thon and instead you are getting a lecture on IEEE-754. I do
                apologize for this, but perhaps it will keep you from committing the ultimate Code-a-Thon author's sin:
                providing incorrect test cases. Fortunately we caught this issue early on, but not before several
                participants wasted time debugging correct code. This was the only problem that wasn't correct, so I
                suppose it could have been worse.</p>
            <p>Now, how is this problem actually solved?</p>
            <p>The problem assumes a completely filled and infinite size <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_tree">ternary tree</a>, where each node is labeled with
                an index. The labeling scheme is straightforward, with the root node having index 1, the nodes on the
                next layer having indices 2, 3, 4, and so on. The first three layers of the tree might look something
                like this:</p>
            <img src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/ternary-tree-layers.svg" width="100%"
                alt="Ternary tree with height three">
            <p>This problem asks the programmer to write a program that provides a series of directions to navigate from
                the root node to some node in tree. The index of this destination node is the input to the program. The
                series of directions should be a string comprised of the characters <code>L</code>, <code>M</code>, and
                <code>R</code>, corresponding to left, middle, and right. Looking at the tree above, we can see that
                input <code>12</code> should produce output <code>RM</code>. Similarly, input <code>7</code> should
                produce output <code>LR</code>.</p>
            <p>It seems that a top down approach is unlikely to work, since the size of the tree grows exponentially
                with each additional layer. Thus, we must start at the specified node and work our way up. To
                generalize, we need a way to find out which child (left, middle, or right) that a given node is of its
                parent. After finding this, we need to find the index of the parent and repeat this process until we get
                to the root node.</p>
            <p>Let's consider a node $i$, where $i$ is the index of the node. How can we find out if $i$ is a left,
                middle, or right child of its parent? Let's consider the indices of all the left children in the tree
                above. We have $\{2, 5, 8, 11\}$. What about the middle children? $\{3, 6, 9, 12\}$. And the right
                children? $\{4, 7, 10, 13\}$. Looking at these three sets we can see a clear pattern. Each right child
                will have an index one greater than some middle child's index and each left child will have an index one
                less than some middle child's index. We can also see that each middle child's index is evenly divisible
                by three. So what would happen if we considered $i \mod 3$? There are three distinct outputs to
                consider: <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>. If we get <code>0</code>, we know that $i$
                is a middle child of its parent, since all middle children have an index divisible by three. If we get
                <code>1</code> we know that $i$ is a right child since all right children have an index one greater than
                a middle child's index (so they are some multiple of three plus one). Lastly, if we get <code>2</code>
                we know that $i$ is a left child since all left children have an index two greater than a middle child's
                index (or one less than a middle child's index, as $-1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$)</p>
            <p>So now we know how to determine if a node is a left, middle, or right child of its parent. How do we get
                the index of the parent? Let's consider each node and its middle child in the above image. We have
                $\{(1, 3), (2, 6), (3, 9), (4, 12)\}$. Each node's middle child has an index exactly three times its own
                index. To find the index of $i$'s parent, we just have to find the middle child nearest to $i$, take its
                index, and divide that by three. At this point, we must repeat the process described in the previous
                paragragh and continue up the tree until we get to the root. At each step up the tree, we record if $i$
                was a left, middle, or right child of its parent. When we reach the root node we print out the
                directions we have recorded in reverse order. We must reverse the order because we recorded the
                directions from the destination node to the root, but we need to output the directions from the root
                node to the destination.</p>
            <p>There is a single edge case for this problem. The constraints indicate that the input of <code>1</code>
                is a possibility. What should we output in this case? From the context of the problem, it would seem
                that no directions need to be given to get to this node, since the node with index <code>1</code> is the
                starting node. Sure enough, the expected output for this input is simply the empty string. This was test
                case 2, and a couple of participants had to put a little bit of extra thought into their solution to
                account for this edge case.</p>
            <p>Let's see some code!</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">n = int(input())

ans = &quot;&quot;

# While we are not at the root node...
while n &gt; 1:
    if n % 3 == 0:
        # We have found a middle child
        ans += &#39;M&#39;
        n = n // 3
    elif n % 3 == 1:
        # We have found a right child.
        ans += &#39;R&#39;
        # The parent node is the middle child&#39;s index divided by three
        n = (n - 1) // 3

        # We have found a left child.
        ans += &#39;L&#39;
        # The parent node is the middle child&#39;s index divided by three
        n = (n + 1) // 3

# Print the directions that we have recorded in reverse
print(&#39;&#39;.join(list(reversed(ans))))
</code></pre>
            <p>We had 30 students correctly solve this problem. Many students skipped straight to this problem since it
                seemed (and was) more straightforward than the Leonhard's Libations. Many students using C/C++/Java
                encountered some difficulties because they were using 32-bit integers to read in the input. We carefully
                chose the input constraint of $2^{63} - 1$ so that the input would fit into an unsigned 64-bit integer.
                I felt bad watching frustrated students see their (logically correct) code failing on large test cases,
                but I was once in their position and learning this the hard way kept me from ever making a similar
                mistake again!</p>
            <p>As a Code-a-Thon author, this problem taught me a lot about writing good problems. I should have tested
                our solution on large (but trivial) test cases. For example, any input of the form $\sum_{i=0}^{h} 3^i$
                should simply output a string of $h-1$ <code>R</code>s, since we have specified the index of a node all
                the way to the right of the $h$'th layer. When $h=60$, $\sum_{i=0}^{60} 3^i =
                63586737412824305271441649801$. Using this as input to our first (and incorrect) solution, we get
                output:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRMLMLLMRMLMRMRRRMMRLLRLRMRLR
</code></pre>
            <p>Gah! If only we had done more testing. Oh well. We will take this as a lesson learned and be more
                thorough with our testing next time.</p>
            <h4>Problem 3: Pricey Power</h4>
            <p>This was the first problem with a difficulty rating of hard. The increase in difficulty was reflected in
                the number of working solutions. Only five participants solved this problem, all of them in division
                one.</p>
            <p>This problem required less raw ingenuity to solve, and more prior knowledge (or <a
                    href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu">Google-fu</a>). For participants well versed in
                graph theory, all it took was one glance at the provided image for the first example (see below) to
                realize this question was about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree">minimum
                    spanning trees</a>. I will frequently use the abbreviation "MST" to refer to minimum spanning trees.
            </p>

                alt="Test case zero path highlighted">
            <p>But that's jumping straight to the solution. Let's analyze the problem to figure out exactly what it's
                asking. SCANA (a real energy company located near Columbia, SC!) has an expensive network of power lines
                connecting houses in their power grids. Each power line connects exactly two houses to one another, and
                has an associated monthly cost. This is a perfect problem to model using a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>. The edges between nodes
                have a numerical value associated with them, so we have a <em>weighted</em> graph. No power line
                <em>generates</em> money; every power line has a positive cost associated with it. Power can move
                through lines freely in either direction, so our graph is <em>undirected</em>. We are told in the
                problem description that there can be multiple power grids in each network, meaning two houses may have
                no connection between them (i.e. no combination of edges in the graph connects those two houses). This
                means that, at least some of the time, our graph is <em>disconnected</em>. Thus, we can model our
                problem using a <em>disconnected undirected weighted graph</em>. For this problem, the input graphs are
                also simple graphs, meaning that any two nodes have only a single edge between them and that there are
                no edges connecting a node to itself. In the context of the MST problem, all self-edges can safely be
                ignored (as they would increase the total cost of a MST without expanding the connected area), and
                multiple edges between the same node can be eliminated by removing all but the minimum weight edge
                between two nodes (as the other edges have no chance of making it into a MST because the minimum weight
                edge between the two nodes will always be the better choice). A versatile MST calculating program should
                be able to account for non-simple graphs with no extra pre-processing, although this was ultimately
                unnecessary for this problem, since the input graphs are all simple graphs.</p>
            <h5>Minimum Spanning Trees</h5>
            <p>So what is a MST anyway? Let's formalize. Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph with a collection of
                nodes (vertices) $V$ and a collection of edges $E$. Each vertex is identified by a label. Each edge is a
                3-tuple containing the labels of the two nodes that the edge connects, and the weight (cost) associated
                with that edge. Let $G_{ST}$ be a spanning tree (ST) of $G$. $G_{ST}$ must have the following
                properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$G_{ST} \subseteq E$, <em>A ST of $G$ is a subset of the edges of $G$. This means that a ST is a
                        collection of edges. A ST is technically a subgraph of $G$ (not a collection of edges), but for
                        our problem we can relax this definition.</em></li>
                <li>$|G_{ST}| = |V| - 1$, <em>There is exactly one fewer edge in a ST of $G$ than there are vertices in
                        $G$. This is because a ST is a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)">tree</a>, and trees are acyclic. If
                        there are $|V|$ or more edges, then this means there must be at least one cycle, violating the
                        acyclic property of trees.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let $G_{MST}$ be a minimum spanning tree of $G$. Let $ST_{G}$ be the collection of all spanning trees of
                $G$. $G_{MST}$ must have the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$G_{MST} \in ST_{G}$ <em>A MST of $G$ is also a ST of $G$.</em></li>
                <li>$\forall G_{ST} \subseteq ST_{G},$ $\sum_{x \in G_{ST} } x_{w}$ $\geq$ $\sum_{x \in G_{MST} } x_w$
                    where $x_w$ is the weight of edge $x$. <em>The weights of the edges in a MST of $G$ must be less
                        than or equal to the sum of weights in any spanning tree of $G$. This means that $G_{MST}$
                        minimizes the weights of a spanning tree of G, which is where the minimum spanning tree gets its
                        name.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>That was a lot of mathematical notation to describe what is a reasonably simple concept. In short, a
                minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is a collection of edges such that every node in the graph
                has a single path to every other node in the graph, and no other collection of edges with this property
                has a lower sum of weights. Note that I was careful to say <strong>a</strong> MST and not
                <strong>the</strong> MST. MSTs are not guaranteed to be unique, which is why this problem asks for the
                sum of weights of a MST rather than some set of edges comprising a MST. All MSTs for a given graph have
                the same sum of weights. This can be concluded directly from the second condition above.</p>
            <p>But wait... this definition is only true for <em>connected</em> graphs, and the input for this problem
                includes <em>disconnected</em> graphs. This is important. There are several famous algorithms for
                calculating MSTs of a graph. The two with which I am most familiar are <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim's algorithm</a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm">Kruskal's algorithm</a>. Out of the box,
                Prim's algorithm does not work on disconnected graphs. Kruskal's algorithm, however, can be used to
                calculate a minimum spanning forest without any modifications. The minimum spanning forest is a
                collection of minimum spanning trees for a disconnected graph: there is one tree in the forest for each
                connected component of the graph. Prim's algorithm can be modified to calculate a minimum spanning
                forest (one particpant's submitted solution did this), but I used Kruskal's algorithm to solve this
                problem.</p>
            <h5>Input Format</h5>
            <p>Before I describe Kruskal's algorithm, allow me to provide some explanation for the input format of this
                problem. Consider the following input for a test case:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">3
0 2 1 5 2 6
1 1 2 4
2 0
</code></pre>
            <p>The first line in this test case means that there are three houses in our power network. The houses are
                always labeled starting with <code>0</code> and going up to <code>n-1</code> where <code>n</code> is the
                number of houses in the network. The next <code>n</code> lines describe the graph, in what closely
                resembles an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list">adjacency list</a>. Each line starts
                with the label of a house. The next number in the line, <code>e</code>, describes the number of
                <em>previously unaccounted-for</em> edges connected to that house (more on that later). The rest of the
                line consists of <code>e</code> pairs of values. The first value of each pair is the label of another
                house in the network. The second value of each pair is the monthly cost of the power line between the
                two houses described by the first value in the pair, and the value at the beginning of the line.</p>
            <p>To work out the example test case above, we can see there are two <em>previously unaccounted-for</em>
                edges that connect to house <code>0</code>. One of these edges connects to house <code>1</code> and has
                a weight of <code>5</code>. The other connects to house <code>2</code> and has a weight of
                <code>6</code>. Onto the next line...</p>
            <p>House <code>1</code> has one <em>previously unaccounted-for</em> edge. This edge connects to house
                <code>2</code> and has a weight of <code>4</code>. We know that house <code>1</code> also has an edge
                connecting it to house <code>0</code>. This is where the <em>previously unaccounted-for</em> part comes
                into play. In a standard adjacency list for an undirected graph, every edge is present in the list
                twice: once for each node that it connects. As its input, Kruskal's algorithm takes a list of every
                edge. If the test cases for this problem were standard adjacency lists, the programmer would have to
                implement some extra pre-processing steps to remove the duplicates. This isn't necessarily very
                difficult, but it is more convienent to read in each edge exactly once.</p>
            <p>Finally, house <code>2</code> has <code>0</code> unaccounted-for edges, since the edges to house
                <code>0</code> and house <code>1</code> have already been accounted for on previous lines. In every test
                case, the last house of the test case will always have <code>0</code> unaccounted-for edges.</p>
            <p>Each input may have more than one test case (a test case looks like the example above). The first line of
                each input specifies the number of test cases. This is done to prevent participants from submitting
                simple programs like <code>print(10)</code> to try to get some free points on any test cases where the
                output might just be <code>10</code>.</p>
            <h5>Disjoint-set Forests</h5>
            <p>Before we discuss Kruskal's algorithm, we must first discuss the data structure that lies at its core:
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure">disjoint-set forest</a>. The
                disjoint-set forest is a data structure that can be used to keep track of sets of items. Kruskal's
                algorithm treats connected componenets of graphs as sets, with the nodes in these components being the
                members of the set. If there exists some path (series of edges) between two nodes in the graph, then
                these two nodes are part of the same set. The disjoint-set forest has three essential operations:
                $MakeSet$, $Find$, and $Union$.</p>
            <p>$MakeSet$ makes a new <em>set</em> which is kept track of internally as a tree. Each node of this tree is
                a member of the same set. Each node of the tree has a couple of properties: a pointer to its parent
                node, and a numerical value called the rank of the node (more on that later). Calling $MakeSet$ will
                initialize a set with a single node in its tree. This node should be initialized with rank
                <code>0</code> and with the parent property pointing to itself.</p>
            <p>$Find$ returns a <em>representation</em> of a given set. This means that if we have two items of the same
                set $x, y$, then $Find(x) = Find(y)$. But what does <em>representation</em> of a set mean? A
                representation of a set is just a specific member of the set. It is important that each member of the
                set return the same representative element when we call $Find$ on it. Since we keep track of our set as
                a tree, our set representative is the root node of the tree. Thus calling $Find$ on a node in our set
                just traverses the tree up to the root node and returns the root. This ensures that each node in the set
                has the same representative, since a tree has only one root node.</p>
            <p>$Union$ combines two sets together. Let's say we have two sets that we want to union: $A$ and $B$ ($A$
                and $B$ are just members of sets, but we can call $Find(A)$ and $Find(B)$ to get the root nodes of those
                sets). If we call $Union$ on these sets, we want them both to be part of the same tree. There are two
                ways we can do this: make the root node of $A$'s tree have a parent pointer pointing to some node in
                $B$'s tree, or make the root node of $B$'s tree have a parent pointer poining to some node in $A$'s
                tree. For correctness sake, it doesn't actually matter which one you pick. No matter which you choose,
                the root node of the resulting tree will still be the same for every element of the set (thus for any
                elements $x,y \in A \cup B$, we have $Find(x) = Find(y)$). For now, let's say that $Union(A,B)$ will
                always make $B$'s tree's root node parent pointer point to the root element of $A$'s tree. I will give
                an example shortly to show why this is not ideal.</p>
            <p>One of the most common uses of disjoint-set forests is to find connected components in a graph. Let's do
                that, considering the following unweighted undirected graph:</p>
            <img style="display: block; max-width: 30rem; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example.svg" width="100%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>Just by looking at the image, we can see that this graph has two connected components: $\{A, B, C, D,
                E\}$ and $\{F, G, H\}$. Of course, for larger graphs with many intersecting edges, this task becomes
                impossible without the aid of computers. We start by calling $MakeSet$ on each node in our graph. Each
                node in the graph becomes the root node in a tree representing the set containing that node. Each tree
                node has the same label as the corresponding node in the above graph, and each node's parent pointer is
                initialized to point to the node itself. Our current disjoint-set forest looks like this:</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example_one.svg" width="100%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>Now we loop over every edge in our graph above. The order in which we loop doesn't matter if we are just
                looking for connected components. Let's start with the edge between $A$ and $B$. We know that $A$ and
                $B$ are in the same set, because there exists an edge between them. We call $Find(A)$ and $Find(B)$ and
                compare these values to discover that they are different ($Find(A)$ returns $A$ and $Find(B)$ returns
                $B$). Because we know they are connected (there exists an edge between them) but our $Find$ calls say
                otherwise, we call $Union(A,B)$ to merge the two sets. After our call to $Union$, our disjoint-set
                forest looks like this:</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example_two.svg" width="87.5%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>Great! Note that $Find(A)$ still returns $A$, but $Find(B)$ now also returns $A$, which indicates to us
                that $A$ and $B$ are in the same set. Now we will consider the edge between $C$ and $D$. Just like
                before, we check if $Find(C) = Find(D)$. It doesn't, but we know these nodes are in the same set, so we
                call $Union(C, D)$. Our disjoint-set forest now looks like this:</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example_three.svg" width="75%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>Now things start to get interesting... let's consider the edge between $B$ and $C$. $Find(B)$ returns $A$
                and $Find(C)$ returns $C$, so we know we need to call $Union$. When we call $Union(B, C)$ we set $C$'s
                parent pointer to point to $B$. We get the following:</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example_four.svg" width="62.5%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>Now we are getting somewhere; $Find(A)$ $=$ $Find(B)$ $=$ $Find(C)$ $=$ $Find(D)$ $=$ $A$; we can easily
                verify that any of these nodes are part of the same connected component in our graph by calling $Find$
                on them and comparing the values. With the way we built the tree, each call to $Find$ runs in
                $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time where $n$ is the number of nodes in each connected component. That's not great...
                fortunately there are some optimizations that let us get this down to nearly constant time. I say
                <em>nearly</em> because the amount of time taken does actually grow with respect to $n$. Specifically,
                the amortized cost of these operations are in $\mathcal{O}(\alpha(n))$, where $\alpha$ is the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function#Inverse">inverse Ackermann function</a>.
                However, if we can guarantee that our input graph has fewer nodes in it than the number of atoms in the
                universe, then $\alpha(n)$ will always be less than 5. So for any practical input, the time complexity
                of these operations are in $\mathcal{O}(5) = \mathcal{O}(1)$, so we can guarantee constant time with
                this input size restriction. I will discuss these optimizations shortly. Fow now, let's finish our naïve
                disjoint-set forest.</p>
            <p>Let's look at the edge between nodes $A$ and $D$. $Find(A)$ returns $A$ and $Find(D)$ returns $A$ as
                well. This means that nodes $A$ and $D$ are already in the same set, so we don't have to do anything.
                Onto the next edge! Let's consider the edge between nodes $A$ and $E$. These $Find$ calls returns
                different values, so we call $Union(A, E)$. Here is the resulting disjoint-set forest:</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example_five.svg" width="50%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>Looking good. When we process the edge between $D$ and $E$ we find that they are already in the same set
                ($Find(D)$ $=$ $Find(E)$), so we do nothing. For brevity's sake, I will perform the remaining
                construction with no explanation. The methodology used is exactly the same as it was in the preceeding
                paragraphs. Our final naïve disjoint-set forest looks like this:</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example_six.svg" width="37.5%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>This isn't ideal though. $Find(D)$ still takes 4 steps through the tree to return $A$ (linear time). We
                want our disjoint-set forest to look like this:</p>
            <img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/disjoint_set_example_seven.svg" width="50%"
                alt="Example graph for disjoint-set forest">
            <p>This way each call to $Find$ will take no more than 2 steps through the tree in the worst case (constant
                time). So how do we achieve a disjoint-set forest like this? We use the optimizations that I mentioned
                earlier. These optimizations are known as <strong>path compression</strong> and <strong>union by
                    rank</strong>. Here is where the nodes' rank variable that I mentioned earlier comes into play. The
                path compression optimization is implemented in the $Find$ function, and the union by rank optimzation
                is implemented (unsurprisingly) in the $Union$ function. We will discuss path compression first.</p>
            <h6>Path Compression</h6>
            <p>The naïve way of implementing $Find$ might look something like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">Find(node)
    if node.parent == node
        return node
    else
        return Find(node.parent)
</code></pre>
            <p>If a node's <code>node.parent</code> property is pointing to itself, then we have reached the root of the
                tree and can return the node. Otherwise, we return the result of calling $Find$ on the parent in order
                to step up the tree one level repeatedly until we get to the root node. But what if we can mutate our
                tree while we traverse up through it? Each node's parent needs only to point to the root of the tree. We
                can change the parent pointers of each node along the path to the root to point directly to the root
                node. We are <em>compressing</em> the paths from the query node (and all nodes on the way up) to point
                directly to the root node. This improved implementation might look like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">Find(node)
    if node.parent == node
        return node
    else
        node.parent = Find(node.parent)
        return node.parent
</code></pre>
            <p>On subsequent calls to $Find$ with the same query node, we now return in constant time. As an added
                bonus, calling $Find$ on any nodes along the path from the query node to the root also return in
                constant time. Awesome! Now let's consider union by rank.</p>
            <h6>Union by Rank</h6>
            <p>The naïve way of implementing $Union$ might look something like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">Union(A,B)
    Find(B).parent = A
</code></pre>
            <p>We are making the root node of the set in which $B$ is a member point to $A$ as its parent, essentially
                splicing $B$'s set into $A$'s set. We can make a very easy optimization that will reduce the height of
                our trees dramatically:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">Union(A,B)
    Find(B).parent = Find(A)
</code></pre>
            <p>This will cause $B$'s tree to get added just below the root of $A$'s tree, shortening the paths from the
                nodes of $B$ to $Find(A)$. This is a big improvement, but we can still do better. In general, we want
                our trees to be as short as possible, to reduce the number of steps that each $Find$ operation takes to
                get to the root. Let's say the tree with node $B$ has height 5 and the tree with node $A$ has height 3.
                If we set $B$'s tree's parent pointer to point to the root of $A$'s tree, then our resulting tree has
                height 6 (the height of $B$'s tree plus one more for the new tree root). However, if we set $A$'s tree's
                parent pointer to point to the root of $B$'s tree, then our resulting tree has height 5 (since the
                height of $A$'s tree was less than the height of $B$'s tree, so $B$'s tree still has the same height).
                We can achieve shorter trees by being smarter about which tree we append to the other.</p>
            <p>So how can we be do this? We want to always append the shorter tree to the taller tree to avoid
                increasing the overall tree height. By keeping track of the maximum heights of each tree, we can
                accomplish this. The rank variable on each node is used to keep track of this maximum possible height.
                We call this variable <em>rank</em> instead of <em>height</em> because the actual height of a tree can
                be changed via path compression; <em>height</em> would be misleading, as this variable does not
                represent the actual height of the tree, only the maximum possible height.</p>
            <p>Recall that the rank of each node is initialized to <code>0</code>. We change our $Union$ operation to
                the following:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">Union(A,B)
    rootA = Find(A)
    rootB = Find(B)
    if rootA.rank &lt; rootB.rank
        rootA.parent = rootB
    else if rootA.rank &gt; rootB.rank
        rootB.parent = rootA
    else if rootA.rank == rootB.rank
        rootB.parent = rootA
        rootA.rank = rootA.rank + 1
</code></pre>
            <p>There are three conditions here. If the rank of the set containing $A$ is less than the rank of the set
                containing $B$, then we change $A$'s tree's root parent pointer to point to $B$'s tree's root, as the
                tree containing $A$ is shorter than the tree containing $B$. If the rank of the set containing $B$ is
                less than the rank of the set containing $A$, we do the opposite: appending the tree containing $B$ to
                the root of the tree containing $A$. If the two ranks are equal, there is nothing clever we can do. We
                simply append one tree to the other and then increment the rank of the new root node (as the full tree's
                height now increased by one). Union by rank prevents us from growing our trees in a linear fashion like
                we did in the example above.</p>
            <p>Together, path compression and union by rank improve the amortized time complexity for our $Find$ and
                $Union$ operations from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha(n))$, which is just $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for
                any practical $n$. I will not present the analysis that leads to these results, but the third edition of
                CLRS covers it in depth in section 21.4 (it takes them eight and a half pages).</p>
            <h5>Kruskal's Algorithm</h5>
            <p>Now that we understand disjoint-set forests, let's discuss Kruskal's algorithm. Don't worry; we are
                almost there. The disjoint-set forest does all the heavy lifting for us. Let's say we have the nodes of
                our graph in a list called <code>nodes</code> and the edges of our graph in a list called
                <code>edges</code>. Each edge is a 3-tuple and has the following three datums: the label of a node $A$,
                the label of a node $B$, and a weight. The edge connects node $A$ to node $B$ with the specified weight.
                The entire pseudocode for Kruskal's algorithm is as follows:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">mstEdges = {}
for each node in nodes
    MakeSet(node)
sort edges by weight
for each edge in edges
    setA = Find(edge.A)
    setB = Find(edge.B)
    if setA != setB:
        Union(setA, setB)
        mstEdges.add(edge)
</code></pre>
            <p>That's it! At the end of this code block, <code>mstEdges</code> contains exactly the edges of a minimum
                spanning tree on our graph. Let's break this code down. We start out by declaring an empty set of edges;
                we will add the edges of our MST to this set as we come across them. Next up, we call $MakeSet$ on each
                node in our graph. This will initialize a new set tree for each node in our graph. Then we sort the
                edges by weight in nondecreasing order. The edge with the lowest weight is in the first index of
                <code>edges</code>, and the edge with the greatest weight is in the last index of <code>edges</code>. We
                then process each edge in our graph. We call $Find$ on the two nodes that the edge connects. If these
                two calls to $Find$ do not return the same set representative, then we have found an edge in our MST.
                This is the lowest weight edge that connects <code>setA</code> to <code>setB</code>. We $Union$ the two
                sets together, and add our edge to our <code>mstEdges</code> set.</p>
            <p>For this problem, we don't actually need to keep track of the entire MST, just the sum of the weights. So
                the pseudocode for the solution to this problem might look like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">sum = 0
for each node in nodes
    MakeSet(node)
sort edges by weight
for each edge in edges
    setA = Find(edge.A)
    setB = Find(edge.B)
    if setA != setB:
        Union(setA, setB)
        sum = sum + edge.weight
</code></pre>
            <p>I really like Kruskal's algorithm because of its simplicity. All we really do is sort the edges in
                nondecreasing order and keep track of the connected components as we add each edge to our MST. Most of
                the complexity exists in the implementation of the disjoint-set forest, which is very good at finding
                spanning trees out of the box. For a graph with $n$ edges, the running time of Kruskal's algorithm is
                $\mathcal{O}(n \lg n)$, which is just the time it takes to sort the edges (this isn't quite true. If we
                have 0 edges and $m$ nodes in our graph, we still call $MakeSet$ $m$ times. Our real runtime is
                $\mathcal{O}(m + n \lg n)$, but for any <em>interesting</em> graph the $n \lg n$ portion dominates).</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about Kruskal's algorithm, I recommend reading section 23.2 of the third
                edition of CLRS. Chapter 21 of the third edition of CLRS also covers disjoint-set data structures in
                more detail than presented here.</p>

            <p>To generate the input graphs, I wrote a small <a href="https://github.com/z2oh/rgg">Rust program</a>. I
                hope to expand this program later to have more functionality. I'm sure I will write another Code-a-Thon
                problem that uses graphs at some point, so this will come in handy.</p>
            <h4>Problem 4: Tingle Towers</h4>
            <p>It is a USC Code-a-Thon tradition to include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tingle">Tingle</a> as
                backstory for at least one problem, thus the story for this problem was born. Slightly more students
                solved this problem successfully than the previous one (six versus five), but I suspect this was because
                the question was easier to Google. The only valid solution for division 2 included this comment:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python"># Borrowed kindly from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lcs-longest-common-subsequence-three-strings/
</code></pre>
            <p>Oh well! We encourage Googling during the competition for two main reasons: we have no way to enforce a
                no-Googling policy (as students can participate from home or elsewhere), and the ultimate goal of our
                Code-a-Thons is to expose participants to more problems or types of problems in computer science, as
                well as getting them to practice implementing them in a competitive setting. As a participant in the USC
                Code-a-Thon several years ago, I learned about the <a
                    href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-fibonacci-algorithms">matrix exponentiation</a> method for
                rapidly calculating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci numbers</a>. I
                implemented this by following pseudocode I found online, and I have not forgotten how it works to this
                day. My only hope is that the student whose code included the above comment took the time to read the
                article and understand how the code worked instead of blindly copying and pasting. For the Code-a-Thon
                in which USC annually participants (<a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM's ICPC</a>), there is no
                internet access. We want students to Google solutions now so that they will remember them later.</p>
            <h5>Longest Common subsequences</h5>
            <p>Anyway, on to the problem. If you read the above code comment you have probably figured out that this
                problem boils down to finding the longest common subsequence of three strings. Each test case presents
                three strings made up of the characters <code>R</code>, <code>G</code>, and <code>B</code>. The goal is
                to find the length of the longest sequence of <code>R</code>s, <code>G</code>s, and <code>B</code>s such
                that this sequence is a subsequence of every input string. Before diving into the solution, let's
                formalize our understanding of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence">subsequence</a>.
            </p>
            <p>First of all, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence">sequence</a> is some collection of
                elements where the order of the elements in the collection is important. A subsequence is a sequence
                built from some other subsequence by removing zero or more elements from the original sequence (but
                preserving the relative order between all other elements). For example, the sequence $\langle 1, 2, 3
                \rangle$ has many subsequences: $\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle$ (obtained by removing no elements from the
                original sequence), $\langle 1, 2 \rangle$, $\langle 2, 3 \rangle$, $\langle 1, 3 \rangle$, $\langle 1
                \rangle$, $\langle 2 \rangle$, $\langle 3 \rangle$, and $\langle \rangle$ (the empty sequence, obtained
                by removing all of the elements from the original subsequence).</p>
            <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence#Common_subsequence">common subsequence</a> of two
                sequences $A$ and $B$ is some sequence that is both a subsequence of $A$ and a subsequence of $B$. A
                longest common subsequence $LCS$ of two sequences $A$ and $B$ is some common subsequence of $A$ and $B$
                such that there exists no other common subsequence of $A$ and $B$ that has more elements than $LCS$.
                These can be generalized from two subsequences to arbitrarily many subsequences.</p>
            <p>For example, given the sequences $A = \langle 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 \rangle$, $B = \langle 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2,
                1, 1 \rangle$, $C = \langle 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3 \rangle$, a $LCS$ of $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $\langle 1, 1, 2
                \rangle$. Note that this is not the only $LCS$ of $A$, $B$, and $C$. For example, $\langle 1, 2, 2
                \rangle$ also fits the critera. Both of these have length three, and there is no length four subsequence
                that is common to $A$, $B$, and $C$.</p>
            <h5>Naïve solution</h5>
            <p>The naïve algorithm to solve this problem finds every possible subsequence of the shortest input string,
                and checks each one for its existence in the other two input strings. If the subsequences are calcuated
                in decreasing order of length (starting with the entire sequence, then all subsequences with length one
                shorter than the sequence, etc.), then as soon as we find a match we return right away. If we exhaust
                all possible subsequences, then we return the empty sequence. This algorithm is a fairly intuitive brute
                force solution. The time it takes for this solution to solve the problem grows with the number of
                subsequences of the shortest input string. For each subsequence, we do a linear amount of work to check
                if the subsequence is a subsequence of the other input strings. So how many subsequences does a sequence
                of length $n$ have?</p>
            <p>We note that the sequence of length $0$ has exactly one subsequence: the empty sequence. Let us consider
                a sequence $S$ of length $k$. $S$ has some unknown number of subsequences $n$. Now consider some element
                $x$. We append the element $x$ to the sequence $S$ to make a new sequence $S'$ of length $k+1$. We note
                that all $n$ subsequences of $S$ are still subsequences of $S'$, because a subsequence is made by
                removing some arbitrary number of elements from the sequence, so the element $x$ can be removed in each
                of these cases. We also note that the <em>new</em> subsequences of $S'$ (those that were not
                subsequences of $S$) are <em>exactly</em> the subsequences of $S$ with $x$ appended to the end. In other
                words, for any subsequence $Q$ of $S'$, $Q$ is either exactly a subsequence of $S$ or some subsequence
                of $S'$ with the element $x$ at the end, which is exactly some subsequence of $S$ with $x$ appended to
                it. This means that by adding $x$ to our sequence $S$, we have doubled the number of subsequences in
                $S'$. In general, a sequence of length $k+1$ has exactly two times the number of subsequences as a
                sequence of length $k$. Since the sequence of length $0$ has one subsequence, this means that a sequence
                of length $n$ has $2^{n}$ subsequences.</p>
            <p>Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">mathematical induction</a>, we
                know that our naïve solution is in $\mathcal{O} (m \cdot 2^{n})$ where $n$ is the length of the shortest
                input sequence and $m$ is the length of the longest input sequence. For $n = m = 100$ (the upper bound
                for this problem) this algorithm would take just over 4000 years to produce an answer if we used all of
                the computing power in the world (using <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/global-computing-capacity/">this
                    2015 estimate</a>). This calculation makes the incorrect assumption that each operation of our
                algorithm is a floating point operation, but our time estimate is accurate enough for us to realize that
                clearly this is not the correct approach.</p>
            <p>Let's break down the problem and figure out a better way to solve it.</p>
            <h5>Analysis of LCS Problem</h5>
            <p>For ease of analysis, we will assume the LCS problem with only two input strings (rather than the three
                provided by this problem). We will generalize later to $n$-dimensions, and then use $n=3$ to write a
                solution. Because this problem asks for the length of a longest common subsequnce, we just need to find
                <em>any</em> LCS of our inputs to figure out our answer (the length of the LCS).</p>
            <p>Let's try working through our sequences backwards. Consider two sequences $A$ and $B$, of lengths $n$ and
                $m$. I will use the notation $S_{x..y}$ to indicate a contiguious subsequence of $S$ from index $x$ to
                index $y$. For example: $A_{1..n}$ is the entire sequence $A$, and $A_{2..n-1}$ is the subsequence of
                $A$ with the first and last elements removed. If the last element of $A$ is the same as the last element
                of $B$ then we know this element will always be in a LCS of $A$ and $B$. We can safely remove the last
                elements from $A$ and $B$ and consider these truncated sequences with their last elements removed. If we
                find a LCS of these two truncated sequences, then we can simply append the element that we had previouly
                removed to the end of that LCS to get a LCS of $A$ and $B$. So when the last two elements of $A$ and $B$
                are the same, $LCS(A_{1..n}, B_{1..m})$ $=$ $LCS(A_{1..n-1}, B_{1..m-1})$ $+$ $A_{n}$. This seems
                useful, but it only works when the last elements of our sequences are the same. What do we do if the
                last element of $A$ and the last element of $B$ are different? Since the last elements of $A$ and $B$
                are different we know that they cannot both be in the same LCS (because if one is the last element of a
                LCS, the other cannot be the last element of the same LCS as it is different). Thus we have three cases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>$A_n$ is in a LCS of $A$ and $B_{1..m-1}$ $\implies$ $LCS(A, B)$ $=$ $LCS(A, B_{1..m-1})$</li>
                <li>$B_m$ is in a LCS of $A_{1..n-1}$ and $B$ $\implies$ $LCS(A, B)$ $=$ $LCS(A_{1..n-1}, B)$</li>
                <li>$A_n$ and $B_m$ are not in any LCS of $A$ and $B$ $\implies$ $LCS(A, B)$ $=$ $LCS(A_{1..n-1},
                    B_{1..m-1})$</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now we are getting somewhere. In general, any time that we are recursively reducing the size of our input
                we are making progress towards a solution. If we can combine these three rules with the above rule (when
                $A_n$ is the same as $A_m$) then we can eventually reduce our problem to $LCS(A', B')$ where either $A'$
                or $B'$ is the empty sequence. $LCS(A', B')$ is just the empty sequence, so when we reach this point we
                can start unwinding our recursion and use the $ + A_{n}$s above to figure out a LCS. Sweet.</p>
            <p>We know that one of the above three cases must be true when $A_n$ and $B_m$ are different, since if all
                cases are false it would imply that $A_n$ and $B_m$ are both in some LCS, which we have already proven
                cannot happen. But how do we know which of these statements is true, and thus which path of recursion to
                travel down? In short: we can't. There is no way to know which of these is true without figuring out
                each one. This seems like a problem... when the last elements of our truncated sequences do not match we
                are making three recursive calls but only reducing our input size to each one by a single element. We
                can model this behavior as a recurrence relation:</p>
            <p>\begin{aligned}
                T(n) &amp;= 3 \cdot T(n - 1) + 1 \\
                T(n) &amp;= 3 \cdot (3 \cdot T(n - 2) + 1) + 1 \\
                T(n) &amp;= 9 \cdot T(n - 2) + 2 \\
                T(n) &amp;= 9 \cdot (3 \cdot T(n - 3) + 1) + 2 \\
                T(n) &amp;= 27 \cdot T(n - 3) + 3 \\
                \dots \\
                T(n) &amp;= 3^{n} + T(n - n) + n \\
                T(n) &amp;= 3^{n} + 1 + n \\
                \Downarrow \\
                T(n) &amp;\in \mathcal{O} (3^n) \\
                \end{aligned}</p>
            <p>Oh no! Our recursive solution doesn't appear to be any better than the naïve one! Fear not: we are closer
                than it appears.</p>
            <p>First of all, we have shown that the solution to an instance of the LCS problem can be obtained from the
                combination of the solutions to that instance's sub-problems. This is known as <strong>optimal
                    substructure</strong>, and is an important property to look for when attempting to solve a problem.
                During our recursion, we are performing a lot of duplicate work. Consider the following example: we are
                calculating $LCS(A, B)$ where $A$ has length $10$ and $B$ has length $10$. Let's look at the sub-problem
                $LCS(A_{1..5}, B_{1..5})$. This sub-problem is called in the $LCS(A_{1..6}, B_{1..5})$ subproblem, but
                also in the $LCS(A_{1..5}, B_{1..6})$ and $LCS(A_{1..6}, B_{1..6})$ sub-problems.This is known as
                <strong>overlapping sub-problems</strong>. Whenever we have both <strong>optimal substructure</strong>
                and <strong>overlapping sub-problems</strong>, we can apply <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> to speed up our
                algorithm.</p>
            <h5>Dynamic Programming Solution</h5>
            <p>The key concept of dynamic programming is recording the results of the overlapping sub-problems so that
                the next time they are called, we can look up our already-computed answer instead of recalculating it.
                This concept is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a>, and is a
                powerful tool in preventing algorithms from doing duplicate work. Often we implement memoization as a
                table; each entry of the table corresponds to a specific sub-problem of the inital problem. For the LCS
                problem, the sub-problems are each possible combination of truncated sequences of $A$ and $B$. If $A$
                has length $n$, there are $n$ possible truncated sequences of $A$. If $B$ has length $m$, there are $m$
                possible truncated sequences of $B$. This means that altogether we have $n \times m$ total sub-problems.
                It makes sense to use a two-dimensional table for the LCS problem applied to two inputs. As we move
                $/rightarrow$ in our table, we increase the number of elements in sequence $A$. As we move $/downarrow$
                in our table, we increase the number of elements in sequence $B$. Tables are easier to visualize on
                computers than they are in our heads. Fortunately for both of us, you happen to be looking at one.</p>

            <p>We have used $LCS(A, B)$ a lot, but haven't really gone over what this function actually
                <em>returns</em>. This depends on what you want to know. If you are looking for the length of the LCS of
                $A$ and $B$, then $LCS(A, B)$ just returns the length of the LCS. If you are looking for an actual
                subsequence, LCS has to return something other that just the length. Despite not needing to find an
                actual subsequence for this problem, I will provide the algorithm for finding it, since it doesn't take
                much additional work.</p>
            <p>"<em>Wait a second...</em>" you may be thinking. "<em>This table only accounts for two inputs! The
                    problem we are solving has three!</em>" Yes, yes, I know. I haven't forgotten about the
                $n$-dimensional generalization. Unfortunately, HTML cannot easily render $n$-dimensional tables. The
                intuition for 2-dimensional vs. 3-dimensional vs. $n$-dimensional is very similar, so I will explain the
                algorithm for two dimensions (with visualizations) and then I will explain the formulation for the
                $n$-dimensional version. Finally, I will provide code for the 3-dimensional version. Don't fret! Back to
                the algorithm:</p>
            <p>There are two main approaches for solving dynamic programming problems. The <em>top-down</em> approach
                attempts to delay filling out entries in the table until they are needed. The <em>bottom-up</em>
                approach fills out the entire table first before attempting to solve the actual problem. In my
                experience, <em>bottom-up</em> is usually the easier, or more intuitive approach. The <em>top-down</em>
                approach sometimes involves many constant-time duplicate table lookups which can impart a performance
                penalty. With <em>bottom-up</em> we have more control over the order in which we fill out the table.
                That said, both approaches are equivalent in terms of their validity. I will present the bottom-up
                approach for this problem: we will start filling out our table in the top left (when $n = m = 1$) and
                work our way to the bottom left (when $n$ and $m$ are at their maximal values). When we finish filling
                out the table, our answer will be sitting in the bottom left entry of our table, ready to be plucked out
                and returned.</p>
            <p>What do we need in an actual table entry? There are two important pieces of information we need to store:
                the length of the LCS at that point and a direction that points toward the previous element in the LCS.
                The direction aspect will make more sense shortly. Let's work out an example, filling out a table as we
                go.</p>
            <p>Our input sequences will be <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan"><code>KERNIGHAN</code></a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie"><code>RITCHIE</code></a>. Let's make a blank
                table. In this example, we are going to zero-index our sequences and table to make it easier to convert
                to code later. Here is our empty table:</p>

                is 0, so we fill in these entries with a 0.</p>

            <p>Now we are going to start filling out our table, starting in the top left. Recall the general recursive
                procedure that we identified earlier:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If $A_n = B_m$ then we remove the last elements of $A$ and $B$ and increase our LCS length by one.
                    We are finished and can return.</li>
                <li>If $A_n$ and $B_m$ are different, we make three recursive calls:
                    i) A recursive call with the last element of $B$ removed ant $A$ left intact
                    ii) A recursive call with the last element of $A$ removed and $B$ left intact
                    iii) A recursive call with the last elements of $A$ and $B$ removed</li>
                <li>Take the maximum of the three recursive calls and return.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the top left corner, we have $A_n = $ <code>R</code> and $B_m = $ <code>K</code>. <code>R</code> and
                <code>K</code> are different of course, so we must make three recursive calls. Our table already has the
                values saved for these three calls! They are the three bordering table cells to the top left. If we want
                to think of these in terms of coordinates, for an entry <code>T[x][y]</code>, the values for our three
                recursive calls are in <code>T[x-1][y]</code>, <code>T[x][y-1]</code>, and <code>T[x-1][y-1]</code>. The
                maximum of three zeroes is, of course, zero, so we put zero in our table and pick a default direction,
                let's use $\uparrow$. The direction is used to indicate which element we removed from our sequence.
                $\uparrow$ indicates that we removed an element from our $B$ sequence (in this case
                <code>KERNIGHAN</code>). $\leftarrow$ indicates that we removed an element from our $A$ string
                (<code>RITCHIE</code>). $\nwarrow$ indicates that we removed an element from both sequences. This will
                become more clear shortly.</p>

            <p>Let's move down the first column. <code>E</code> and <code>R</code> don't match so we do the same thing
                as before. The max of all our recursive calls is zero, so we fill in a zero and our default direction
                ($\uparrow$). The next table cell is more interesting. <code>R</code> and <code>R</code> match!
                Referring back to our procedure, we want to remove an element from both sequences and increase the LCS
                length by 1. We point $\nwarrow$ (because we removed an element from both sequences) and set our LCS
                length to be $LCS(A_{1..2}, B_{1..1}) + 1$ (the value in the cell one cell $\nwarrow$ from the current
                cell). Here is what our table looks like:</p>

            <p><code>N</code> and <code>R</code> don't match, so we make our three recursive calls. This time, the
                return values are $0$, $0$, $1$. The max of these is $1$ -- a tie no longer! This means that the LCS of
                <code>R</code> and <code>KERN</code> is $1$, which makes sense because <code>R</code> is in both
                sequences. But now what do we do with our direction? We want our direction to indicate which element we
                must remove to get the LCS with length $1$. We can't point $\nwarrow$$, because the LCS of
                <code> </code> and <code>KER</code> has length zero. We can't point $\leftarrow$ because the LCS of
                <code> </code> and <code>KERN</code> also has length zero. We always want to point to the table cell of
                the recursive call that returned the greatest length LCS. When we have a tie, it doesn't matter which
                one we point to (earlier when we had ties of $0$, $0$, and $0$ we just pointed $\uparrow$. We could have
                also pointed $\leftarrow$ or $\nwarrow$, it wouldn't have mattered. If we wanted to recover <em>all</em>
                LCSs of $A$ and $B$, then we would have to remember <em>all</em> the directions in case of a tie). The
                rest of this table row follows the same pattern; the $1$ gets passed all the way down (since after we
                pass the <code>R</code> in <code>KERNIGHAN</code>, we will always have a LCS of length one with
                <code>R</code>). This table looks like this:</p>

            <p>Let's fill out the second column. We are now computing the LCS of <code>RI</code> with every truncated
                sequence of <code>KERNIGHAN</code>. <code>I</code> and <code>K</code> don't match, and neither do
                <code>I</code> and <code>E</code>. We have ties for zero on our recursive calls, so we have a LCS of
                length zero with direction $\uparrow$, as before. <code>I</code> and <code>R</code> don't match, but
                <code>RI</code> and <code>KER</code> do have a subsequence of length one, and this is captured in our
                recursive call to compute the LCS of <code>R</code> and <code>KER</code>. We mark down a length of one
                and point to the cell that gave us this value (in this case, $\leftarrow$).</p>

            <p>Now for <code>I</code> and <code>N</code> we have a three way tie for our recursive calls. I will choose
                to continue to prefer pointing $\uparrow$ in the case of a tie. We keep the LCS length of one and point
                $\uparrow$. Next up we have <code>I</code> and <code>I</code>, a match! We take the LCS of $A$ and $B$
                with the last elements removed, increment its length by one, and note that as our new LCS length. We
                point $\nwarrow$ to indicate that we removed the last element from both $A$ and $B$.</p>

            <p>Great! The rest of this column and the next two columns follow suit with the previous ones. For the sake
                of brevity, I will fill out the table up to the <code>H</code> column. If you are reading this for
                understanding, I encourage you to first attempt filling out the table on your own and then checking your
                results with mine. Practice makes committing these algorithms to memory much easier!</p>

            <p>The <code>H</code> column mostly follows suit with the previous two, until we get to the match at
                <code>H</code> and <code>H</code>. At this point, like previous matches, we point $\nwarrow$, take the
                value out of that cell, and increment it by one. Let's see what that looks like:</p>

            <p>The next column is a bit interesting because of the match with <code>I</code>. At this point we have a
                match so we point $\nwarrow$ and increment that value by one. But this means we have a tie with the cell
                one in the direction $\leftarrow$. This is because at this point we have two subsequences of equal
                length (two). We can take <code>RI</code> from <code>RITCHIE</code> in two different ways, using the
                first or the second <code>I</code>. We would have to account for this if we were attempting to enumerate
                all possible subsequences; but we are not, so we follow along with our normal rule of pointing
                $\nwarrow$.</p>

            <p>We are finished! Now that we have our table, what is the length of our LCS? That is exactly $LCS(A, B)$,
                which is the call in the bottom right corner of our table. Thus the length of our LCS is three. If this
                is all the information we wanted to know (like in the case of Tingle Towers) then we are finished.
                However, because we marked down the direction we can also recover a LCS from our inputs. Starting in the
                bottom right corner, we follow the arrows until we get to a matching character. We note this down and
                keep following the arrows. Eventually we will get to the top row or the leftmost column and the
                characters that we have marked down form a LCS. Here is what this trace looks like:</p>

            </center>
            <p>The path that we trace through the table is colored red, and the matching elements are highlighted.
                Looking at these highlighted cells, we know that a LCS of <code>KERNIGHAN</code> and
                <code>RITCHIE</code> is <code>RIH</code>! Filling out each cell in the table takes a constant amount of
                work and there are $n \times m$ cells in the table. Thus our dynamic programming algorithm is in
                $\mathcal{O} (nm)$, substantial savings over the $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ cost of the naïve algorithm.</p>
            <p>This algorithm is intuitive, fast, clever, and is a shining example of the power of dynamic programming.
                The LCS problem pops up all over the place in real world applications too, so this algorithm is a useful
                one to keep in your algorithmic toolbox. It also makes a killer Code-a-Thon problem! Don't worry, I
                still haven't forgotten.. without further ado, the $n$-dimensional generalization.</p>
            <h5>$n$-dimensional Generalization</h5>
            <p>To calculate a LCS of $n$ input sequences, we follow the exact same procedure that we did in two
                dimensions but with a slightly modified procedure. If we have a match for the last elements in all input
                sequences, we remove the the last elements of each sequence, take the LCS of those sequences, and
                increment by one. So in the case of a match of the last elements, we have $LCS(S_1, S_2, \dots , S_n)$
                $=$ $LCS(S_{1, 1..l_1-1}, S_{2, 1..l_2-1}, \dots , S_{n, 1..l_n-1})$.</p>
            <p>When the last elements do not match, we must make recursive calls to find the LCS for each possible
                combination of sequences with zero or one elements removed. For $n$ input sequences, there are $(2^n)-1$
                recursive calls to make. For $n=2$ or $n=3$ this isn't that bad (3 and 7 calls, respectively), but for
                many inputs even our dynamic programming solution cannot solve this problem effectively. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman">Richard Bellmen</a> (the inventor of dynamic
                programming) calls this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of
                    dimensionality</a>.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, for three input strings this problem is still computationally feasible. We must make our
                table three dimensional. Instead of the three directions from before, we now have seven. I notate these
                by the combinations of axes in three dimensional space that each direction points along. We have
                <code>X</code> <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> for when the direction goes straight along each axis,
                <code>XY</code> for when the direction points at a $\frac{\pi}{4}$ angle between <code>X</code> and
                <code>Y</code>, and <code>XZ</code> and <code>YZ</code> with similar explanations. Finally, the XYZ
                direction is the equivalent to our $\nwarrow$ direction in the two dimensional example above and
                indicates the removal of the last element for each of our input strings. It's difficult to visualize
                this 3D table in your head (and even harder on paper). For four or more dimensions this visualization
                becomes impossible, although we can still utilize the algorithm using the exact same approach, keeping
                an $n$-dimensional array as our table.</p>

            <h4>Problem 5: Team Rocket's Capture Caper</h4>
            <p>This problem fulfills another USC Code-a-Thon tradition: using Team Rocket as the backstory for a
                problem. Usually our Team Rocket problems are some variant on graph search (DFS, BFS, or Dijskstra's). I
                decided to change it up this year and do a problem type that we have never done before. This problem was
                one I hadn't actually solved before, so it was fun to implement the solution for the first time.</p>
            <p>In this problem, Team Rocket is capturing Pokemon in a field using a net. The Pokemon are scattered all
                over the field, and we are given the x and y coordinates of each one. We are asked to find the minimum
                area of some net that Team Rocket needs to capture all the Pokemon in one go (meaning the net must be
                big enough to cover every Pokemon in the field). There is a catch though, the net must be a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon">convex polygon</a>: if we were to imagine a line
                from any corner of the net to any other corner of the net, this line must be entirely contained within
                the polygon. I actually forgot to specify this restriction in the problem description at first (oops!).
                I was able to clarify this pretty quickly after someone asked me about it with an example. Fortunately,
                most students assumed that this restriction was in place, as the main component of this question is a
                famous problem in computer science.</p>
            <p>This problem has two components to it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding the points on the grid that make up the net</li>
                <li>Finding the area of the net</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first component is where the bulk of the work takes place, and is the primary focus of this problem.
                We need to find a convex polygon that covers all the points in a set of points. When I Google "convex
                polygon that covers a set of points" the fourth result is the Wikipedia page for <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">Convex Hull</a>. Sure enough, the convex hull
                problem is the problem we are attempting to solve.</p>
            <p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms#Algorithms">many algorithms</a>
                that can be used to calculate the Convex Hull of a set of points. I opted to use <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan">Graham's Scan</a> for its intuitiveness and for its
                presence in CLRS. I will describe Graham's Scan, and then a method for calculating the area of a convex
                polygon.</p>
            <h5>Graham's Scan</h5>
            <p>I love algorithm visualizations. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a visualization is worth a
                million. Wikipedia user Shiyu Ji has created an excellent animation showing the operation of Graham's
                Scan. Take a moment to watch this animation, and then I will explain in detail what is going on.</p>

            <p>The first thing we must do is select a starting point from which to build our convex hull. This starting
                point should be the lowest point in our set (the point with the lowest y-coordinate). In the case of a
                tie, we want to select the leftmost point (so we minimize the y-coordinate first, then we minimize the
                x-coordinate). This point can be found in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time where $n$ is the number of points in our
                set. Note that this point <em>must</em> be a point in our convex hull, since no other point is lower
                (and thus would be able to provide coverage over this point). This initial point we will call $p_0$.
                Next we must sort our remaining points in order of increasing polar angle with respect to $p_0$. Picture
                a radar system with a scan line rotating counter clockwise. As the scan line rotates around the origin,
                it highlights points on the radar. If our origin is point $p_0$ and the points that get highlighted on
                the radar are the remaining points in our data set, then the order in which the points get scanned by
                the radar is the order in which we want our points to be sorted.</p>
            <p>We are using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system">polar coordinate
                    system</a> with $p_0$ as our origin. Given the x and y coordinates of a point, we can easily
                calcuate the angle it forms with the origin by using the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2">$atan2$</a> function present in most programming
                languages. $atan2(y, x)$ will return the angle that $(x,y)$ forms with the point $(0,0)$. We want to
                know what angle $(x,y)$ forms with $p_0$, however, so we must <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)">translate</a> our set by the vector that
                points to $p_0$. This is pretty easy to do; if $p_0 = (x', y')$ then we just need to subtract $(x', y')$
                from every other point. This can be done in our for loop while we calculate the angles. Assuming we have
                our $p_0$ stored in a variable <code>p0</code> and the rest of our points stored in some variable
                <code>points</code> our pseudocode would look like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">for point in points
    point.angle = atan2(point.y - p0.y, point.x - p0.x)
</code></pre>
            <p>Then we simply sort <code>points</code> by the <code>angle</code> property on each point, and we have our
                list of points in counterclockwise order around $p_0$! There are two extra optimizations we can do here:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>If we have three points (let's say $p_0, p_1, p_2$, with $p_0$ being our origin point as above)
                        such that all three points are <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity">colinear</a>, we don't need to keep the
                        middle point on the line in our set of points. This is because any convex hull that includes the
                        two outer points on the line would also include the inner point. Because $y \geq y'$ for all
                        points compared to $p_0$, for any two points with the same polar angle with respect to $p_0$ we
                        can simply forget the one with lower y coordinate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>$atan2$ is a more expensive operation than we need to perform. In fact, we can simply use the
                        slope of the line that is formed between $p_0$ and every other point. This requires some extra
                        logic (slope increases from 0 to $\infty$ until we cross the y-axis and start getting negative
                        values from $-\infty$ to 0) but should perform slightly faster since we are only doing a few
                        basic integer arithmetic operations. However, this does not change the algorithmic complexity of
                        the algorithm, so I chose to omit this optimization from my solution.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once we have our points sorted in counterclockwise order, we initialize a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a> and push the first three
                points from our sorted list (starting with $p_0$) onto the stack. Note that our stack must implement a
                $Peek$ function to return the value of the top element of the stack (without removing it from the stack)
                as well as a $Peek2$ function which returns the value of the second element in our stack (again without
                removing it from the stack). Now we iterate over the remaining points in our sorted list and perform the
                following procedure:</p>
            <ol start="0">
                <li>The point we are considering in our current iteration of our for loop is stored in a variable
                    <code>point</code>. The top of our stack is returned by the function <code>stack.peek()</code>. The
                    second to top element of our stack is returned by the function <code>stack.peek2()</code>.</li>
                <li>We consider the angle that is made between <code>stack.peek2()</code>, <code>stack.peek()</code>,
                    and <code>point</code>.</li>
                <li>If this angle is a <strong>left turn</strong> then we push <code>point</code> onto our stack and
                    contiune to the next point in our for loop.</li>
                <li>If this angle is a <strong>right turn</strong> then we pop the top value off of our stack and go
                    back to step 1 repeating this, until we get a left turn.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In pseudocode, this might be implemented like the following:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">for point in points
    while angle_between(stack.peek2(), stack.peek(), point) is right_turn
        stack.pop()
    stack.push(point)
</code></pre>
            <p>You should be asking yourself, "how do we define a left turn or right turn?" I'm glad you asked. If we
                picture a car driving from <code>stack.peek2()</code> to <code>stack.peek()</code> and then to
                <code>point</code>, then we are interested in the direction that the driver turns her wheel when she
                gets to <code>stack.peek()</code>. If she turns the wheel left, this is a left turn. If she turns the
                wheel right, this is a right turn. It's a fairly intuitive concept, but it's less intuitive to
                calculate. Similarly to before, we don't actually need to calcuate the angle. We instead use the
                geometric properties of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a> to
                figure out the turn direction. If $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, $p_3 = (x_3, y_3)$, then
                algebraically we can figure out the turn direction using the following formula:</p>
            <p>$$D = (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1)$$</p>
            <p>If $D$ is positive then we have a left turn. If $D$ is negative then we have a right turn. If $D$ is 0
                then the three points are colinear and we can treat it as a left turn (pushing our point onto the stack
                and continuing).</p>
            <p>After reading this, rewatch the above animation. The points connected by the red line segments are the
                points in the stack; the last two points connected by a red line segment are the top two points in the
                stack. The point connected by the blue line segment is the point that we are considering in the current
                iteration of our for loop. The animation does a great job of showing how the convex hull is constructed
                using this algorithm.</p>
            <p>When we finish the procedure above for all the points in our set, the points in the stack are exactly the
                points that form the convex hull, in counterclockwise order. So how long does Graham's scan take? The
                actual convex hull calculating time in the procedure we described above runs in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time;
                this result is perhaps somewhat surprising, but each point is only considered at most a constant number
                of times, so this step runs in linear time on the number of points. However, we had to sort our points
                earlier by their relative polar angles with our initial point. Sorting our set of points takes
                $\mathcal{O}(n \lg n)$ time, which dominates the overall runtime of our algorithm. Thus Graham's scan is
                in $\mathcal{O}(n \lg n)$ where $n$ is the number of points for which we are finding the convex hull.
            </p>
            <p>After the application of Graham's scan, we now have the points of our convex hull, convienently sorted in
                counterclockwise order. The bulk of our work is complete, but we must still find the area of our net in
                order to return an answer. Fortunately, this is fairly easy to compute.</p>
            <h5>Area of a Convex Polygon</h5>
            <p>A brief story: on my search for a convienent algorithm for convex polygon area calculation I stumbled
                upon <a
                    href="http://www.dummies.com/education/math/algebra/finding-the-area-of-a-triangle-using-its-coordinates/">this
                    Math for Dummies</a> post on how to find the area of a triangle using its coordinates. Below is a
                screenshot of the article that I linked:</p>
            <center>
                <img src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/dummies.png"
                    style="width: 100%; max-width: 725px;" alt="Dummies article">
            </center>
            <p>If we use our classic $A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot base \cdot height$, we can see that the area of this
                triangle is 25 square units, not 50. The author forgot to divide by two in their calculation! Naturally,
                I submitted an eratta report to Wiley so that they may fix this error. On March 20th I received the
                following e-mail in response:</p>

            <p>A little less than a month later, I received this e-mail:</p>
            <center>
                <img src="/assets/posts/spring-2018-code-a-thon-solutions/dummies_email_2.png"

            </center>
            <p>Looks like they have acknowledged the error! As of writing this (April 25th) the article in question
                still has not been updated, but I have hopes that it will get fixed soon. Hopefully before some poor
                geometry student fails a homework!</p>
            <p>Anyway, the algorithm for finding the area of a convex polygon is quite simple, especially if the points
                of the polygon are already sorted in counterclockwise order (like they are after Graham's scan). It
                wasn't until after the Code-a-Thon that I learned that there is a well known name for the method that I
                employed: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula">shoelace algorithm</a>.</p>
            <p>Essentially, the way the shoelace algorithm works is by breaking the polygon into triangles, calculating
                the area of the rectangle around each triangle, and then subtracting the areas of each region in the
                rectangle that is not part of the triangle (of which there are exactly three). Wikipedia provides a good
                explanation of how this works in the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula#Proofs">proofs section</a> of the page linked
                above.</p>
            <p>The formula for this area calculation looks like this:</p>
            <p>$$A = \frac{1}{2} | \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}y_{i}|$$</p>
            <p>where $n$ is the number of points we have and $p_i = (x_i, y_i)$. Note that the above formula will
                reference the point $(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$. We desire this overflow point to loop back to the first point,
                so $(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) = (x_1, y_1)$.</p>
            <p>Implementing this is pretty straightforward:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">area = 0
for index in range(0, points.length - 1)
    p0 = points[index]
    p1 = points[index+1]
    area = area + p0.x * p1.y - p1.x * p0.y
first = points[0]
last = points[points.length - 1]
area = area + last.x * first.y - first.x * last.y
area = area / 2
</code></pre>
            <p>We iterate through every point and perform our computation with it and the next point. When we get to the
                end, we have a special case to handle the last multiplication that will wrap around our list of points.
                We divide our running total by a factor of 2 (this is where Wiley messed up) and then we have our area!
                We can print out this value and we have our answer.</p>
            <h5>Discussion</h5>
            <p>I explicitly disabled the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> programming language
                for this problem, because it has a built-in <a
                    href="https://octave.org/doc/v4.2.1/Convex-Hull.html">convex hull function</a>. However, I did not
                disable the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> programming language, which also has a built-in
                convex hull function. One participant noticed this and exploited it to get a working solution. This is
                perhaps unfortunate, but a good programmer should always exploit available tools, and I salute this
                student for their ingenuity. Three other students found code that solved this problem somewhere online
                and exercised their Ctrl+C Ctrl+V muscles to solve this problem. This is impossible for us to police, so
                I only hope that these students took the time to understand the code that they were copying. I do know
                that one student (the first place winner at that!) took the time and effort to implement a solution
                manually. Props to this student! If they ever need to implement a convex hull algorithm again, they will
                be the best prepared for this feat.</p>
            <h5>Code Solution</h5>
            <p>The full Python code for my solution is below:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">import math

n = int(input())
points = [[0, 0, 0]] * n

for i in range(n):
    points[i] = list(map(float, input().split(&#39; &#39;))) + [0]

# Sort by x and then y
points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

# Remove the first point, which is the lowest leftmost points. This point is
# part of our convex hull.
p0 = points[0]
points = points[1:]

# Now we determine the polar coordinates of each point relative to p0
# We don&#39;t actually have to compute the angle here, but this is still O(n)
# so we won&#39;t worry about it for now.
for point in points:
    point[2] = math.atan2(point[1] - p0[1], point[0] - p0[0])

# We sort by the polar angles to make a stack of increasing polar coordinates
# relative to p0
points.sort(key = lambda x: x[2])

# If two points have the same radial angle from p0, the point closer to p0
# (the one with smaller x and y coordiates) can be removed as it cannot be
# part of our convex hull. This reduces the number of points we need to process
# later.
removal_indices = []
for i in range(len(points) - 1):
    if points[i][2] == points[i+1][2]:
        removal_indices.append(i)

for index in reversed(removal_indices):
    points.pop(index)

# We perform Graham&#39;s scan on the points to determine the convex hull.
stack = [p0, points[0], points[1]]
for i in range(2, len(points)):
    p3 = points[i]
    cross = -1
    while cross &lt; 0:
        p1 = stack[-2]
        p2 = stack[-1]
        # This quickly calculates the cross product between p1p2 and p1p3.
        # If `cross` is 0, the points are colinear. If `cross` is positive we
        # have made a left turn and can move on to the next point. If `cross` is
        # negative, we have made a right turn and pop the top point and
        # continue.
        cross = (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])
        if cross &lt; 0:
            stack.pop()
    stack.append(points[i])

# Now `stack` contains the points of our convex hull in counterclockwise order.
# We can now calculate the area of the polygon.
# This is the de-facto way of computing area for a 2D convex polygon, and is
# an application of Green&#39;s theorem.
area = 0
for i in range(1, len(stack)):
    area += stack[i-1][0]*stack[i][1] - stack[i][0]*stack[i-1][1]
# Account for the wrapping from the last point to the first...
area += stack[-1][0]*stack[0][1] - stack[0][0]*stack[-1][1]
area = area / 2

print(area)
</code></pre>
            <p>Several students ran into an issue in their area calcuation code where they did not wrap around to the
                first point. This is an error I made while coding my initial solution, so I sympathized when people
                showed me <em>almost</em> working code that forgot to account for that last edge in their polygons.
                That's not a mistake those students will make again!</p>
            <h4>Problem 6: Zucchini Zipping</h4>
            <p>This was, based on the questions I received from participants, the hardest problem to understand. There
                is a reason that my explanation was so... strange. This question was inspired by (based on... or
                actually ripped off of) a problem from the 2014 ACM-ICPC southeastern region qualifier. After reading my
                shoddy explanation for my version of the problem, read problem H of <a
                    href="http://serjudging.vanb.org/wp-content/uploads/SER-2014-D1-Problems.pdf">that year's problem
                    set</a>. Make more sense? Card shuffling is a very natural way to represent this problem, but I
                avoided using that analogy because I didn't want people to be able to Google for it and find the
                original problem. Thus "zucchini zipping" was born! I tried my best...</p>
            <p>This problem was the hardest problem in this semester's problem set. Only two students solved it (the two
                that solved every problem). This is because this was the only problem that required some level of
                personal ingenuity. Not to say that the other problems were easy; they weren't. But the other hard
                problems in our problem set were testing students' algorithms knowledge and their ability to implement
                these algorithms. Pricey Power was the minimum spanning tree problem; Tingle Towers was the longest
                common subsequence problem; Team Rocket's Capture Caper was the convex hull problem. But this problem
                wasn't a wrapper around some other famous computer science problem: it was a problem that required a
                custom algorithm to solve a unique problem.</p>
            <h5>The Problem</h5>
            <p>I will use the card shuffling analogy that was used in ICPC, as it is much easier to understand. Picture
                a deck of $N$ cards, labeled from $1$ to $N$. We split the deck in two by taking $M$ cards off the top.
                We now have two stacks of cards, one with $M$ cards and one with $N-M$ cards. We now take some arbitrary
                number of cards off the bottom of the first stack of cards and add it to a third stack. Then we take an
                arbitrary number of cards from the second stack and add them onto the third stack. We alternate back and
                forth between the two stacks until all cards have been moved into the third stack. Let's walk through an
                example:</p>
            <p>We have the cards one through eight in a stack:</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>We split this stack into two stacks. We pick an arbitrary location to perform the split: for this exmaple
                let's have a stack from $1$ to $5$ and a stack from $6$ to $8$.</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>Now we take some arbitrary number of cards from the bottom of the first stack and add it to a new third
                stack. Let's take $1$ and $2$. Now we have:</p>
            <p>$$
                3, 4, 5
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2
                $$</p>
            <p>Now let's take only one card from the second stack ($6$):</p>
            <p>$$
                3, 4, 5
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 6
                $$</p>
            <p>Back to the first stack. Let's take two more.</p>
            <p>$$
                5
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 6, 3, 4
                $$</p>
            <p>Let's now take the rest of the second stack:</p>
            <p>$$
                5
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>We have only one option at this point. We must take the rest of the first stack, since our second stack
                is empty. Our once-shuffled stack now looks like this:</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5
                $$</p>
            <p>We can repeat this operation. After shuffling the above (once-shuffled) card sequence, we can end up with
                many different combinations. Here are some examples:</p>
            <p>$$
                6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 1, 2
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2, 5, 6
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6
                $$</p>
            <p>That last example is interesting... let's start from a fresh sequence and do another example:</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>Split between $6$ and $7$,</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
                $$
                $$
                7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>We will take the first four from the first stack, then the entire second stack, and then the remainder of
                the first stack. We are left with:</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6
                $$</p>
            <p>That's the same sequence that we got in our third example above! So this sequence can be reached using
                both one and two shuffles. This is important, because we are only interested in the
                <strong>minimum</strong> number of times a sequence has been shuffled. For the above sequence, the
                answer is one.</p>
            <h5>Analysis</h5>
            <p>Before attempting to be clever, it's often a good idea to at least consider a brute force solution. Even
                if the resulting solution is too slow, it usually enhances one's intuition about the problem. How would
                we go about brute forcing this problem? We know the starting point (cards numbered from $1$ to $N$) and
                ending point (it's given to us in the input). We know that we are looking for the minimum number of
                shuffles needed from the starting point to the ending point. So if we consider all possible sequences
                generated with one shuffle, then with two shuffles, three, etc., as soon as we find a match we return
                the iteration we are currently on (one shuffle, two shuffle, etc.). For our analysis, we need to know
                how many possible ways there are to shuffle $N$ cards. Let's consider the case with four cards.</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4
                $$</p>
            <p>There are five places we can split this sequence: <code>| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |</code>. If we split the
                sequence at the first or last location, then we always get the same sequence as before. If we split
                between the <code>1</code> and the <code>2</code>, then we can get <code>1 2 3 4</code>,
                <code>2 1 3 4</code>, <code>2 3 1 4</code>, or <code>2 3 4 1</code>. If we split between the
                <code>2</code> and the <code>3</code>, we can get <code>1 3 4 2</code>, <code>1 3 2 4</code>,
                <code>1 2 3 4</code>, <code>3 1 2 4</code>, <code>3 4 1 2</code>, or <code>3 1 4 2</code>. If the split
                between the <code>3</code> and the <code>4</code>, then we can get <code>4 1 2 3</code>,
                <code>1 4 2 3</code>, <code>1 2 4 3</code>, or <code>1 2 3 4</code>. Thus there are 16 ways to shuffle
                four elements once. Then for each of our 16 results, we will have 16 more results. By the time we have
                reached our fourth shuffle, we will have checked over 65 thousand sequences; that level of growth is not
                promising. You may have noticed that we are doing lots of extra work. Even in the 16 shuffles that I
                gave above, there were duplicates. We don't ever need to consider a sequence more than once, since the
                first time we find our sequence will be the minimum number of shuffles we have. This seems like it could
                be a good application for dynamic programming. We make a table for every possible sequence and fill it
                out until we have found our desired sequence. We will need a table entry for every possible sequence.
                Since our original sequence has $n$ distinct elements, there are $n!$ many <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutations</a> of the sequence. The input
                constraint gives us an upper bound of $n=2^{20}$. Unfortunately there is not enough matter in the
                universe to keep a table of $2^{20}!$ sequences in memory, so there must be a better way.</p>
            <p>Let's think about what happens when we perform a shuffle. We split the deck into two sequences from $1$
                to $k$ and from $k+1$ to $n$. These sequences are then shuffled together, but the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence">subsequences</a> are preserved in both. Thus we now
                have 2 contiguous subsequences of our original deck. When I say contiguous subsequence of our original
                deck, I mean that we now have some subsequence of our shuffled deck that was a contiguous subsequence
                (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring">substring</a>) of our original deck. Thus
                <code>2 3 4</code> could be a contiguous subsequence of our original deck, but <code>2 3 5</code> could
                not be. Now what happens when we shuffle again? Let's look at an example, slightly longer this time.</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>Split in the middle...</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4
                $$
                $$
                5, 6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>And then shuffled together,</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>Notice we have two contiguous subsequences of our original deck: <code>1 2 3 4</code> and
                <code>5 6 7 8</code>. Now let's shuffle again:</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>Split in the middle...</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 5, 2, 6
                $$
                $$
                3, 7, 4, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>And then shuffled together,</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>We now have four contiguous subsequences of our original deck: <code>1 2</code>, <code>3 4</code>,
                <code>5 6</code>, <code>7 8</code>. Notice in the worst case, we can have eight contiguous subsequences
                of our original deck. This would be when we have <code>8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1</code>. How many shuffles does it
                take to get here? Let's try it out.</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4 | 5, 6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>to</p>
            <p>$$
                5, 1, 6, 2 | 7, 3, 8, 4
                $$</p>
            <p>to</p>
            <p>$$
                7, 5, 3, 1 | 8, 6, 4, 2
                $$</p>
            <p>to</p>
            <p>$$
                8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
                $$</p>
            <p>So it takes three shuffles. This means in the worst case, three shuffles will produce eight different
                contiguous subsequences of our original deck. Hmm... one shuffle makes two subsequences, two shuffles
                makes four subsequences, and three shuffles makes eight subsequences. There's a pattern here! If we have
                $n$ contiguous subsequences of our original deck present in our shuffled deck, then we must have
                shuffled our original deck a minimum of $\log_{2} n$ times. What if we have a number of subsequences
                that is not a power of two? That's okay; if we have two subsequences it means our deck was shuffled
                once. We can never get three subsequences from shuffling once. If we have four subsequences, then our
                deck was shuffled twice. So three subsequences is obtainable from two shuffles, but not one. We can take
                the ceiling of our log operation to get the definitive answer.</p>
            <p>This is a great move in the right direction. We now have a way to relate the number of shuffles that were
                performed to the number of contiguous subsequences of our original deck that are present in our shuffled
                deck. Now we need a way to find how many contiguous subsequences of our original deck there are in our
                shuffled deck.</p>
            <h5>$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ solution</h5>
            <p>Let's consider the twice shuffled deck from our previous example:</p>
            <p>$$
                7, 5, 3, 1, 8, 6, 4, 2
                $$</p>
            <p>We know the four contiguous subsequences of our original deck are <code>7 8</code>, <code>5 6</code>,
                <code>3 4</code>, and <code>1 2</code>. Looking at this, it seems like we can start at the left of our
                sequence and scan through the sequence looking for the next contiguous value. Every time we find this
                next value in our sequence, we remove it from the sequence. The number of times we scan through our
                array is exactly the number of contiguous subsequences of our original deck that we have. Let's see what
                this would look like:</p>
            <p>We start with <code>7 5 3 1 8 6 4 2</code>. We start with <code>7</code> and then scan through our
                sequence looking for an <code>8</code>. We find the <code>8</code> and then keep scanning for a
                <code>9</code>. Since there is no <code>9</code> in our sequence, we reach the end of the array and
                remove the <code>7</code> and <code>8</code>. Now we are left with <code>5 3 1 6 4 2</code>. We start
                with <code>5</code> and scan through our sequence looking for <code>6</code>. We find the <code>6</code>
                and then keep scanning for a <code>7</code>. We do not find the <code>7</code> as it was already
                removed, so when we reach the end of the array we take out <code>5</code> ant <code>6</code>. We have
                now gone through the array twice. We have <code>3 1 4 2</code>. Startinig with <code>3</code>, we will
                scan until we find the <code>4</code> and then reach the end. We are now left with <code>1 2</code>. We
                do one last scan, remove <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> and are left with an empty sequence. We
                scanned through the array 4 times, so we have 4 contiguous subsequences of our original deck which means
                this deck must have been shuffled twice ($\log_{2} 4 = 2$).</p>
            <p>We now have a solution! Let's look at its worst case performance. We will consider the case
                <code>8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1</code>. Looking at this, it seems we will have to scan through our array 8 times,
                once for each subsequence. In general, for a sequence of $n$ numbers we will have to scan through the
                array $n$ times in the worst case. This means our solution is in $\mathcal{O} (n^2)$. Much better than
                checking each of the $n!$ permutations. But can we do better?</p>
            <h5>$\mathcal{O}(n)$ solution</h5>
            <p>The answer to that question (as it usually is) is yes. Since we need to know how many subsequences of our
                original deck we have, it seems likely that we will have to check every element in the sequence at least
                once. $\mathcal{O} (n^2)$ is too slow but it seems unlikely we can go sublinear. Thus, let's look for a
                linear solution. For a linear solution, we need a way to find the number of subsequences in our sequence
                using only a constant number of passes over our array. Let's consider some element of our sequence $k$.
                We know that $k$ is between $1$ and $n$ where $n$ is the number of elements in our sequence. $k$ is part
                of some subsequence in our original deck. The preceeding element in this subsequence is $k-1$ and the
                next element in our subsequence is $k+1$ (unless $k=1$ or $k=n$; we will not consider these cases for
                the sake of generalization). If $k-1$ is in our shuffled deck before $k$, then $k$ continues the
                subsequence in which $k-1$ was the previous element. If $k+1$ is in the shuffled deck after $k$, then
                $k+1$ contiunes the subsequence in which $k$ is its previous element. We want to know the total number
                of subsequences of our original deck, so we can simply find the number of elements that start
                subsequences of our original deck (since each subsequence has exactly one starting element). What is a
                starting element of a subsequence? It is some element $k$ where $k-1$ does not come before $k$ in the
                shuffled deck. Conversley, an element $k$ is <em>not</em> the first element of some subsequence if $k-1$
                has come before it in the deck. This seems promising...</p>
            <p>Let's iterate through our shuffled deck. We start with the first element, we will call it $k$. Of course,
                it is impossible to have seen $k-1$ earlier in the deck, so $k$ must be the first element of some
                subsequence of our original deck. We increment some <code>SequencesFound</code> counter. We also want to
                somehow let element $k+1$ know that it is not the first element of a subsequence, since $k$ came before
                it in the deck. We can't do a linear time operation here, because then our final solution would be in
                $\mathcal{O} (n^2)$, so scanning for element $k$ is out. We need some kind of constant time operation.
                Amongst the most common constant time operations are array accesses in which index to access is already
                known (or can be computed in constant time). We don't know the index of element $k+1$, but we do know
                its value (it's $k+1$). We also know that every element in our deck is unique and that we have exactly
                $n$ elements. So we can index into a <em>different</em> array using index $k+1$. We set the value of
                some other array at index $k+1$ to <code>True</code>, to indicate that element $k+1$ is not the first
                element of any subsequence. We continue our iterating through the array... fast forward until we are
                considering element $k+1$. We check our secontary array at index $k+1$ and find the value
                <code>True</code>. This indicates to us that we have already found element $k$ previously in our deck,
                so we do not increment our subsequence counter. We do, however, set index $k+2$ in our secondary array
                to <code>True</code> to indicate that $k+2$ is not the starting element of some subsequence.</p>
            <p>Let's walk through an example.</p>
            <p>Starting with the following deck:</p>
            <p>$$
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>we shuffle once to obtain</p>
            <p>$$
                4, 5, 1, 6, 2, 3, 7, 8
                $$</p>
            <p>and then shuffle again to obtain</p>
            <p>$$
                8, 4, 5, 1, 6, 2, 3, 7

            <p>Only two more. We see $3$, note that it is <code>True</code> in the other way, and then mark $4$ as
                <code>True</code>. Then we reach $7$, note that it is <code>True</code>, and mark $8$ as
                <code>True</code>. We have reached the end of our array! We take $\log_2$ of the number of sequences
                ($3$) and then take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">ceiling</a>.
                $\lceil \log_2(3) \rceil = 2$, which is the number of shuffles that we performed. We only scanned
                through the array once and performed a constant amount of work for each array element, which means we
                got an answer in linear time! Awesome!</p>
            <h5>Code Solution</h5>
            <p>The full Python code for my solution is below:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-"># Read in number of test cases.
t = int(input())

# For each test case.
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the number of zucchinis.
    n = int(input())

    # Grab the heights of each zucchini in a list.
    heights = list(map(int, input().split(&quot; &quot;)))

    # Build our other list and initialize to False. We use two extra indices
    # to avoid having to do bounds checking.
    expect_next = [False] * (n + 2)

    # We keep track of the number of sequences we have found in `count`.
    count = 0

    # For each zucchini, if we have not seen the previous zucchini
    # (with height - 1) we increase our count by 1. We then set the value for
    # our next zucchini (with height + 1) to True, indicating we expect to see
    # it further along in the sequence.
    for h in heights:
        if not expect_next[h]:
            count += 1
        expect_next[h + 1] = True

    # We take the ceiling of the log_2 of count...
    log = 0
    while 1 &lt;&lt; log &lt; count:
        log += 1

    # And print out our answer.
    print(log)
</code></pre>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Wow, when I started writing this solution guide I did not expect to reach 10,000 words, let alone 20,000.
                I know that was a lot to read, but I hope if you stuck through it that you learned something that you
                may be able to apply in your schoolwork, a Code-a-Thon, a technical interview, or some other programming
                endeavor. These types of problems may not come up every day, but when one does, having an efficient
                solution can be all the difference in the world.</p>
            <p>To those who participated in the Code-a-Thon, thank you for your participation. I love writing
                Code-a-Thon problems, but it would all be for naught if there were not bright students eager to solve
                them. Thanks again to the <a href="https://sc.edu">University of South Carolina</a> and the <a
                    href="https://cse.sc.edu">Department of Engineering and Computing</a> for providing space and
                support for the Code-a-Thon. Thanks to USC-ACM for support in organization and advertising (and for
                being the computing club of choice for most of our participants)! Thanks to <a
                    href="http://krum.io">Krumware</a> for providing pizza in a solid attempt to placate the insatiable
                hunger of a room full of collegiate programmers. Lastly, I thank my wonderful Mom who proofread this
                entire post despite never before having read a single line of code.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or you have found any errors, please e-mail me at jadaytime (at) gmail.com.
                Unfortunately I can't send you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">hexadecimal
                    dollar</a>, but I will be very grateful nonetheless.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
